The very first thing that you must note while making Chicken 65 is, the longer you marinate the chicken, the tastier it will be. You can marinate the chicken for up to 2 days.
For that crispiness, you can either use rice flour or cornflour while preparing the marinade.
If the sourness of yoghurt is enough, add a teaspoon of rice vinegar in it. This will provide the much-needed sour taste to the dish.
Always use chicken thighs for making this dish, as they are juicier and have high-fat content in it.
